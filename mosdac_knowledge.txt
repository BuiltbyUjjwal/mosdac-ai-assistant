INSAT-3D is an Indian weather satellite used for meteorology and disaster warning. It carries a sounder and an imager.

INSAT-3DR is its successor and includes improved weather imaging, vertical profiling, and data relay.

Megha-Tropiques is used to study tropical water cycles and monsoons. It carries instruments like SAPHIR, SCARAB, and MADRAS.

Scatterometers are instruments that measure wind speed and direction over the ocean.

Rainfall data on MOSDAC is derived from INSAT, SCATSAT, and Megha-Tropiques and used for flood monitoring, forecasting, and agriculture.

MOSDAC also provides cyclone alerts, temperature maps, and cloud movement animations.

Use of MOSDAC includes disaster management, weather monitoring, early warning systems, agriculture planning, and climate study.
